A simple infection method
-------------------------

This method was inspired by Silvio Cesare (http://vxheaven.org/lib/vsc02.html).
(Read the "The non ELF infector file virus (file infection)" section)

In order to make the executable strip safe, the idea is to load the host in memory.

$ make
$ ls -l target
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dbourbaki dbourbaki 6768 Feb 23 11:35 target

--> infected.s
%define SIZE 6768

$ make infected
nasm -f bin infected.s -o infected
cat target >> infected
$ ./infected
Infected !
I am the target
$ strip infected
$ ./infected
Infected !
I am the target
